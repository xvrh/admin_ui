# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- A refresh the user did not ask for can run in the background:
  `AsyncValueController.refresh(background: true)` and
  `CollectionController.refresh(background: true)`. Nothing on screen says it
  runs: `loading` keeps its value and no progress bar shows. The value or the
  rows change in place when the answer lands, and a failure still shows as the
  error. Use it after an edit, on a push or on a timer.
  `CollectionRealtime.bind(background: true)` refetches that way. A local
  change that settles while a background refresh runs is kept on the page it
  lands, as it is for any other load.
- Every control the kit builds can be found by a key the app gives it, so a
  test reaches it without its words, in any language. A data object that
  describes a control takes `key`, put on the control built for it, or on its
  row when a narrow layout folds it into a menu: `NavItem`, `MenuItem`,
  `MenuCheckboxItem`, `MenuSubmenu`, `TabItem`, `SegmentOption`,
  `ChoiceOption`, `SwatchOption`, `AccordionSection`, `StepItem`, `Crumb`,
  `BulkAction`, `SaveBarAction`, `ComboboxOption`, `SelectOption` and
  `FilterOption`. A widget or a function with a control of its own takes
  `<part>Key` for it: `showConfirmDialog(confirmKey:, cancelKey:)`,
  `ErrorState(retryKey:)`, `Modal(closeKey:)`, `SideSheet(closeKey:)`,
  `SaveCluster` and `SaveBar(saveKey:, commitKey:, discardKey:)`,
  `FormSaveBar` and `FormActions(commitKey:, discardKey:)`,
  `FormWizard(backKey:, nextKey:)`, `Pagination` and
  `Pager(previousKey:, nextKey:)`, `Collection(previousPageKey:,
  nextPageKey:)`, `Toast(actionKey:)`, `BulkActionBar(clearKey:)`,
  `SearchField(clearKey:)`, `SignInForm(emailKey:, passwordKey:, submitKey:,
  forgotKey:)`, `SetPasswordForm(newKey:, confirmKey:, submitKey:)`,
  `ChangePasswordForm(currentKey:, newKey:, confirmKey:, submitKey:)` and
  `NewPasswordFields(newKey:, confirmKey:)`. A folded `IconAction` keeps its
  key on its row in the save bar's menu. `FormWizard` keyed its footer by
  `ValueKey('back')` and `ValueKey('next')`, which an app's own `Key('next')`
  equals; it now keys them by a type of its own. The README's API conventions
  say the rule, and *Testing an app on the kit* shows it.
- A tap target leaves its text out of any `SelectionArea` above it: `Tappable`,
  `CursorRegion`, `Button`, a `CollectionTable` row that opens, a cell edited
  on a double tap and a column header (both under the arrow), a field's label
  (which focuses the field, under the arrow cursor a browser gives a label),
  a tags field's box, a collapsible field group's header, a reference field's
  result rows and load-more, and the image cropper's aspect chips. Before, a
  drag across their labels selected them and only the cursor changed, or the
  I-beam showed. `MentionText` under a tap target stays
  plain rather than opening a selection area of its own, which also put a
  second Tab stop inside the target. The example's selection sweep pumps every
  demo under a `SelectionArea` and fails on selectable text under a target.
- Every control shows the hand off the web too, so a development build on the
  desktop looks like the shipped web app. `Button`, the tree's caret, a
  collapsible field group's header, a reference field's rows and load-more and
  the image cropper's aspect chips took Material's platform-adaptive default,
  the arrow off the web, while `Tappable` showed the hand. A selected option,
  a selected swatch and the current page number show the hand like a selected
  tab (they showed the arrow), and a kanban card that opens shows the hand
  even when it can also be moved (it showed the open hand).

### Looks

- Stock Material widgets under `buildAppTheme` draw the accent the way the
  kit's own controls do, at its contrast target. The label of an
  `OutlinedButton` or an `ElevatedButton`, and a selected `ListTile`, take
  `primaryText`; a checked `Checkbox`, a selected `Radio`, a `Switch` that is
  on and a `TabBar`'s indicator take `controlAccent`, their check and thumb
  `onControlAccent`. They took `primary`, which a light brand accent leaves
  under 4.5:1 as text and under 3:1 as a control. Among the shipped themes,
  the labels move in Iris Dark, Ant, Fluent Dark and Carbon Dark, and the
  controls in Fluent Dark only. The catalog's Foundations / Stock Material
  page shows them under the theme's accent and under a light one.

## 0.1.0

The first release. [README.md](README.md) describes the kit: the app frame,
collections and data tables, forms and field bodies, overlays, media and
asset pickers, comments and mentions, version history, charts and sign-in
screens, themed from one set of design tokens in six themes with a light and
a dark mode each. [`api.txt`](api.txt) lists its public surface and
[`looks.txt`](looks.txt) every theme's resolved tokens.
